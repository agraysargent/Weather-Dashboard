# Weather-Dashboard

This assignment required us to create a weather dashboard, which would allow folx to view the upcoming weather schedule for the next five days. The weather dashboard will utilize html and css in conjunction with jquery, bootstrap, in addition to javascript.

# User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
